exerpt: Tiffy is a travel planning freak, formerly an Asia Pacific finance manager
  and currently a digital marketing ninja. Despite being a nervous flyer with plane
  jolts sending chills down her spine, Tiffy’s wanderlust has led her to visit Japan
  for 6 times (and counting). Her favorite cities are Kyoto and Tokyo and would choose
  to visit Japan over Paris in a heartbeat!
